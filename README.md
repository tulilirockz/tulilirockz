# A bit about me ðŸŒ·

I'm a bit shy, but I love listening to everyone and I'll try to help out as much as I can!

I'm aiming to be as versatile as possible, working with backend and frontend technologies, making games, fun side projects, and whatever else! I'm especially interested in cloud-native technologies, like CoreOS, NixOS, Fedora Silverblue, [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and Kubernetes
