# A bit about me ðŸŒ·

I'm a bit shy, but I love listening to everyone and I'll try to help out as much as I can!

I'm aiming to be as versatile as possible, working with backend and frontend technologies, making games, fun side projects, and whatever else! I'm especially interested in cloud-native technologies, like Azure, and operating systems, especially immutable ones like CoreOS, NixOS, Fedora Silverblue and some of it's [derived projects](https://universal-blue.org/)

I also love photography! I don't exactly have a public profile right now, but whenever I do, I'll link it here

Feel free to say [hello](mailto:tulilirockz.pub@gmail.com?subject=Hello!)! Much love, and hope you all are doing well ðŸŒ¸ðŸ’•
